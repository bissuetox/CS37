While node does not have 3 values
	If node has no children
		Insert value into node (adjust w/ larger on right)
			Might have to handle switching L/R
		Else
			Traverse left, mid or right
				Left = value is < node left value
				Mid = value is left < x < right
				Right = value is > right

If Node has 3 values
	Adjust(node)
		split left and right values in new separate nodes
		set parent node's L/R pointers to new nodes
		If parent has 3 nodes
			Adjust(parent)
